This is a client site that was worked on in class over the winter 2025 semester. Its a cheese website that works in a very simmilar way to the cheese and thank you site also found on my profile. Users can add, edit, and delete cheeses. The major difference is this site uses an api that was created using NODE.js (also found on my profile) alongside the front-end site that was built using angular. There is also user account creation, verification, and deletion functions. Check it out!
